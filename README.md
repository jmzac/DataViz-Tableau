###Data visualization and analysis of the Skagit River Bridge Collapse

In this respository I have shown images of a Tableau visualization used to identify the Skagit River Bridge. A story board was created using Tableau to higlight the Skagit River Bridge details from the whole data.

The storyboard contains two slides, unsafe bridges in Washington State and a second slide giving the description of the Skagit River Bridge on the map. The screenshots of the two slides are shown below:

In the second screenshot, shows the candidates narrowed down to the Skagit River Bridge

###Based on this information, we can answer the following questions surrounding its collapse.

Whatâ€™s the rating of the Skagit River Bridge that collapsed into the river?
It has a sufficiency rating of 46, which is below 50 and hence the bridge is eligible for replacement.

What other distinguishing information can we obtain that might go into a story?
This Bridge is owned and maintained by the State Highway Agency

When was the bridge last inspected and how often is it inspected?
The Bridge was last inspected in 2015 and the frequency of inspections given is 24.

Is it considered fracture-critical, meaning one hit to a span can knock it out?
Yes, it has a fracture-critical rating of Y24 hence it can collapse with a major hit to a span.

How much average daily traffic does it get?
The bridge gets an average daily traffic of 70,948 based on the data
